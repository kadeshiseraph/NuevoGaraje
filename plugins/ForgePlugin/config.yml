# Main configuration for ForgePlugin.
---
# General settings.
# Note: At optimal performance levels, there are 20 ticks per second.
settings:
  # After a chunk is loaded, it will be re-checked to ensure that it should be remain loaded.  Specify the number of
  # MINUTES (ticks-per-second-dependent) before that check occurs.  Useful when players are exploring.
  recheck-delay: 1

  # If there are more than this many entities in a chunk when it is unloaded, it won't be checked for remaining players.
  entity-check-limit: -1

  # Maximum number of chunks that a persistent chunk range can contain.
  max-chunks-per-range: 100

  # Time in TICKS between inventory scans.  After this number of ticks, the plugin will scan all players' hands for
  # banned items.
  inventory-scan-interval: 20

  # Time in MINUTES between complete chunk scans.  Every chunk is checked for players; if none are found in a chunks,
  # and it is not in a persistently loaded region, the chunk is forcefully unloaded.  If you know how to do so, you
  # should automate this as a cronjob (Linux) or scheduled task (Windows), as the timing of the built-in system is only
  # accurate at 20 TPS.  (Have the task/cronjob run the /cc command.)  Don't forget to disable the built in system by
  # specifying a negative value here if you plan on using your own timed system.  Warning: Disabling this and not
  # running the /cc command periodically will quickly exhaust your RAM--sort of like Tekkit without this plugin.
  # CraftBukkit added this feature around 1.5, but there's no support for Tekkit Classic, obviously.
  chunk-clean-interval: 5

# Cleans up after bugs that rapidly spawn items.
entity-overflow:
  # Time in seconds between entity scans.  After this number of ticks, the plugin will scan all chunks for entity
  # overflows.  Set to -1 to disable.
  scan-interval: 5

  # Exceeding this number of entities in one chunk will result in it being cleared of most types of entities.  Set to
  # -1 to disable.  Even if scan-interval is negative, this will still have an effect when entities are individually
  # spawned: if the chunk currently meets or exceeds this number, new entities cannot be spawned normally.  Mods can
  # bypass this, hence the scanner.
  max-entities: 150

  # This delay must occur between item drops in the same chunk, or they will be ignored.  Separate from scanning.
  # This will prevent players from dropping items too quickly, so ensure that players know that it is enabled.
  # Negative value disables.  Set to -1 to disable; disabled by default.
  min-item-interval: -1

  # Delay in seconds before the threshold is reset to that specified by entity-overflow.max-entities after being
  # automatically increased.  A temporary increase will occur if too many players are in one chunk, so as to prevent
  # the abnormal increase in players from triggering the entity overflow mechanism.  The increase gets triggered when
  # max-entities is exceeded *and* the number of players in the chunk exceeds max-players-before-increase.  Set to
  # 0 to prevent the threshold from ever reseting (equivalent to infinite delay).  Set to -1 to disable the increased
  # threshold mechanism.
  threshold-reset-delay: 30

  # Used to determine when there is an excessive number of players in a chunk, so as to prevent too many
  # players from repeatedly triggering the entity overflow mechanism.  See threshold-reset-delay for more information
  # about this feature.
  max-players-before-increase: 50

# Items take the format "ID:data".  They will be removed if the player interacts.  Use ID:0  if you only want to ban
# the item with data value 0.  IDs lacking data values or with a data value of -1 will ban all data values for that ID.
# You can put the name of the item after the ID:data entry for documentation, and it will be ignored.  Items that are
# often seen with varying data values should have a data value of * (asterisk) for documentation purposes.
#
# Note that data values over 127 work with items, but not blocks.
